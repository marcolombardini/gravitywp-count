# gravitywp-count
Plugin that adds a shortcode option to count a number field in multiple entries of Gravity Forms

If you use a number field in your Gravity Form, you may want to count the total of this number field for multiple entries. With this simple plugin that’s possible.

<h2>1. Install the GravityWP Count plugin</h2>

First install the GravityWP Count plugin. Go to your wp-admin Dashboard, click on Plugins and choose for ‘Add New’  and than for ‘Upload Plugin’.

<h2>2. Use the shortcode</h2>

If the plugin is successfully installed, you can use the following shortcode anywhere on your WordPress website:

<b>[gravitywp_count formid="" field=""]</b>

You need to give the shortcode two variables:

<b>formid:</b> this is the ID of the Form you want to make the calculation for. You find it when you go to Forms in your Dashboard and than the first column will show you the ID of the form.

<b>field:</b> this is the Field ID of the Number Field you want to count. Open the form and scroll to the Number Field.
